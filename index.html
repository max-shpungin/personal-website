    <h2 id="transition">my career transition</h2>
    <section id="intro">

      <div class="text-container">


          <p>After an amazing few months of getting married and traveling, I've decided to embark on a new adventure: I will be attending the Rithm School full-stack web development program in November 2023.
          </p>
          <p>
            Playing with Javascript and Python has been a not-so-secret passion of mine for a long time - these technologies are intertwined with the way the web (and therefore digital marketing and analytics!) work today. I'm so excited to fully pursue these areas of software and web development now as a formal part of my career journey :)
          </p>

          <h3>here's how I would describe my career to this point</h3>
          <p>A digital analytics professional with executive-level experience.

            Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to work with amazing businesses of all shapes and sizes, across a wide variety of industries including travel (Virgin America and Alaska Airlines), b2b SaaS (AWS Marketplace, Github, Demandbase), direct to consumer (Thermos, Sephora), finance (Capital One, Xero, SoFi), and security (Malwarebytes, Tenable).

            Some of the most common problems I help organizations solve for include:
            <ul>
              <li>

                Website analytics architecture, tag management, and data quality
              </li>
              <li>
                Website user flow and engagement analysis

              </li>
              <li>
                Marketing tech stack strategy, operations, and integration

              </li>
              <li>
                Reporting automation, data visualization, and dashboarding

              </li>
              <li>
                Conversion rate optimization (CRO) and A/B testing

              </li>
              <li>
                Account Based Marketing (ABM) program development and measurement strategy</p>

              </li>
            </ul>

    <h2>a bit about me</h2>
    <section id="about-me">

      <div class="text-container" id="text-area">
        <p>I love my cat Chloe, video games, and my wife - not necessarily in that order. I've been a digital marketing analytics consultant for too many years, working for smaller and larger agencies in pretty much every role you can imagine from analyst to executive.</p>

      <p>I tried to study computer science once upon a time in college but I flunked out of school (actually, multiple schools - my amazing advice: don't skip classes and do your homework :)), but I've tinkered with Javascript throughout my career and I'm excited to really dive into the deep end again.</p>

      <p>Also I used to dance salsa competitively in a previous life and there is a weird amount of somewhat embarrassing video evidence on the internet.</p>

    <h2>matters of great import</h2>
    <section id="musings">
      <div class="text-container">

        <p> Tacos are a terrible vehicle for food. I'm not talking about the ingredients that go inside, it's just a terrible format. It's supposed to be "street food" but no one really walks around eating tacos - they are way too messy and get everywhere.

        Burritos are a far superior format because they are enclosed.</p>

        <p> Baldur's Gate 3 was good for what it was, but it felt like a very narrow experience compared to the sense of scale and adventure evoked by the older Baldur's Gate games. Also the stories of the side companions all felt far too consequential and high stakes - it created a lack of believability in the world and scenario for me that was not present in BG1 for example.</p>

        <p>Starfield was.... okay. I'm still waiting for a game that recreates the spirit of the original wing commander: privateer. It was marketed as a space exploration game, and it just isn't. Also they made space exploration boring somehow.</p>
