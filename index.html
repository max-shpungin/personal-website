    <h2>a bit about me</h2>
    <section id="about me">
      <p>I love my cat Chloe, video games, and my wife - not necessarily in that order. I've been a digital marketing analytics consultant for too many years, working for smaller and larger agencies in pretty much every role you can imagine from analyst to executive.</p>
      <p>I tried to study computer science once upon a time in college but I flunked out of school (actually, multiple schools - my amazing advice: don't skip classes and do your homework :)), but I've tinkered with Javascript throughout my career and I'm excited to really dive into the deep end again.</p>
      <p>Also I used to dance salsa competitively in a previous life and there is a weird amount of somewhat embarrassing video evidence on the internet.</p>
